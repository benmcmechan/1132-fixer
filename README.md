Minimal macOS app with one action:

- `Start Zoom`: spoofs a random MAC address on the active Wi-Fi/Ethernet interface, automatically disconnects/reconnects that network service, kills Zoom, clears Zoom local data/cache/preferences/log state, requests admin access to flush system DNS caches, and relaunches Zoom

The app runs local recovery commands for Error 1132 and performs network interface MAC spoofing/reconnect plus DNS cache reset via AppleScript (`do shell script ... with administrator privileges`) so macOS can present native admin-password prompts.

Recent compatibility update: MAC address changes now try `ifconfig ... lladdr ...` first and fall back to `ifconfig ... ether ...` to avoid failures seen on newer macOS versions (including Sequoia).

## Updates

On launch, the app checks the GitHub Releases `latest` endpoint and prompts if a newer version is available.
